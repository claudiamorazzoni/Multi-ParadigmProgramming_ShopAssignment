# Overview of Assessment-ML-S

In this short report I will compare two ways (procedural and object oriented programming) of writing a code studied in the multiparadigm classes. 
This discussion is based on the solutions reached to create a store by implementing procedural and object-oriented approaches.

The task was to add extra functionality to the purchasing program in the procedural scheduling C and Python languages, and the object-oriented language Python.
Additional features required include reading the store's CSV with the store's initial value and customer orders. 
The store processes the order of the customer and updates the money in the store based on the amount of money received, and throw an error if the quantity of the product the customer wants to buy is not enough in store stock. 
Also, the store must work in live mode. So the user can enter the name of the product to be processed.
